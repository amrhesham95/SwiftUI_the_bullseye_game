# SwiftUI_the_bullseye_game
The objective of the game is to put the bullseye as close to the target as you can. The bullseye is on a slider that goes from 1 to 100, and the target value is randomly chosen. In the screenshot above, you’re challenged to put the bullseye at 40. Since you can’t see the current value of the slider and there aren’t any markings to help you, you have to “eyeball” it.
